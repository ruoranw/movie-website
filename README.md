## MovieWebsite
MovieWebsite is a small project that shows movies on a web page. With every click on the image, the trailer shows.

## How I build it?
This project uses [fresh_tomatoes](https://github.com/aaronharmon/udacity-python-fresh-tomatoes) python to turn the movie.py to a website with a generated html file. The fresh_tomatoes python file is built by the [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com). The movie.py contains the parent `class Movie` which is used in media_center.py.

## Usage
To use this project, simply replace movie objects in the media_center.py file with new movies information. The
```movie_list = [inside_out, doctor_strange, up, life_of_pi, curious, legends] ```
should also be replaced.
**Note:** this project needs Python installed.
